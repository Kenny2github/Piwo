## Piwo - Python In, Wikitext Out

Compiles and executes Python code stored in wiki pages.

The Gram: (short for Program:) namespace is the script file namespace, and needs the `gram-edit` permission to edit, since as of now there is no environment control.

The only system message is a reminder to purge pages after editing a script.
